Traffic accidents and congestion are one of the "newest" problems big cities must confront in modern days, where more and more people acquire vehicles and their use is contantly increasing. The reference to this topic as a problem is due to not only the high density of citizens living in big cities, adding the subsequent high number of cars, but the amount of people that visit the city for various purposes as working, tourism, etc. In the end, these situations provoke from traffic congestion, as the least severe consequence, to accidents with material losses, injured people or even deaths, in the worst case scenario. In general basis, governments are concerned about these tragic events because they consumed resources, as money for reparations or healthcare material, human lives in some cases and, in the case of companies, it can also mean a decrease of productivity, due to the workers arriving late due to congestion. For that reason, dealing with the issues that come with traffic is a hot topic in areas with high density of people. 

In that regard, being able to understand the features that trigger those mentioned traffic problems is key in the effort of finding solutions to those issues in the future, saving money for the governments, problems to the rest of the citizens and even lives.
